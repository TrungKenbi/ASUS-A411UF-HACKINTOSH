## Overview
This repository is provided for ASUS Vivobook S14 variant specific model A411UF with X411UF Motherboard.
as the model name said, it has 14" display with nano edge display(their branding name).
Nano edge style makes the physical of this laptop feels like 13" laptop.

# Extra notes
## Replaced hardware
### Wifi
I am recommending DW1560 as your hackintosh wifi card rather than DW1820A.
It has a better stability, no hardware gambilng, etc.
I choose DW1820A because it's cheap af ;), but you will hard to find the compatible device id.
you could use this [guide] (https://osxlatitude.com/forums/topic/11479-dw1820a-guide-compatible-property-not-overriding/)

i left a source code for enabling broadcom wifi card in "hotpatch" folder if you're willing to use DW1560 rather than DW1820A.
## hotpatch
uncompiled hotpatch are present in "hotpatch" folder and can be used for other purpose.
